# Office C2R Custom Install

## Notes

-   If the below guide is confusing to you then the simplest option for you is to use [Office C2R Installer](/download_windows_office/office_c2r_links).
-   Retail Office (e.g. O365) has latest feature updates and Volume Office (e.g. ProPlus 2021) doesn't.
-   Please note that in the official C2R office custom installation method, there is no ISO or any one-click solution available. Below is the simplest guide to installing customized office.

## Custom Installation Guide

First, you'll need to clear previous installations of Office. You can skip this if Office has never been installed on the machine before:

-   Uninstall Office with the App and Features option in Windows settings.
-   Run `OfficeScrubber.cmd` file from [Office Scrubber](https://github.com/abbodi1406/WHD/raw/master/scripts/OfficeScrubber_12r.zip) by abbodi1406 and select `[R] Remove all Licenses` option.

Once you're done:

-   Download [Office Deployment Tool](https://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/wsus/setup.exe) (ODT)
-   Copy the downloaded `setup.exe` file to the root of the C drive, i.e. `C:\setup.exe`
-   Go to [config.office.com](https://config.office.com/deploymentsettings)
-   If you want Retail Office then select `Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise` in the office suites section.
-   If you want Volume Office then select `Office LTSC Professional Plus 2021 - Volume License` in the office suites section. (Don't select the SPLA version)
-   You can add Visio and Project apps if you need them. Don't select language that is [not available for Project/Visio](/download_windows_office/office_c2r_links) if you are installing those apps.
-   Customize other things and leave settings as default if you don't understand something.
-   Once you go through all the options, click on the export button, select "Keep Current Settings" option and it will download a file named `Configuration.xml`
-   Copy the downloaded `Configuration.xml` file to the root of the C drive, i.e. `C:\Configuration.xml`
-   Open the command prompt as admin and run the below commands

    ```         
    cd /d C:\
    setup.exe /configure Configuration.xml
    ```

It will now download and install Office. You can activate it with your preferred method.
